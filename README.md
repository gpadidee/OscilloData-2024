# OscilloData-2024

Project Description

This project was a semester-long coding assignment involving C, MATLAB, and LabVIEW.

The goal was to develop a program that, when provided with a specific type of .jpg image (oscilloscope screenshots taken at an angle), could automatically process and analyze the data. The code straightens the images, detects the plotted curves, and determines the best fitting model for each curveâ€”either a sinusoidal function or a third-degree polynomial. The resulting cleaned and reconstructed plots are then exported as PDF files.

Please note that only the .jpg files in the test folder should be used, as they follow a specific formatting convention:

Each curve is represented by a distinct color.

The four corners of the oscilloscope screen are uniquely colored, allowing the program to identify and correct the perspective.
